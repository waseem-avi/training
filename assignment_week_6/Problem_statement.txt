Earthquake Prediction Model with Machine Learning


Importing Necessary Libraries:
Begin by importing the required libraries for data manipulation, visualization, and machine learning algorithms such as pandas, numpy, matplotlib, scikit-learn, and keras.

Loading and Reading the Dataset:
Load the earthquake dataset into a DataFrame and read its contents to understand the data structure and features.

Main Characteristics of Earthquake Data:
Extract the main characteristics of the earthquake data, including date, time, latitude, longitude, depth, and magnitude.

Scaling Data:
Scale the data, particularly the date and time, by converting them to Unix time (seconds since the Unix epoch) to prepare them for model input.

Data Visualization:
Visualize the earthquake data on a world map to depict the frequency and distribution of earthquakes based on latitude, longitude, and magnitude.

Splitting the Dataset:
Divide the data into input features (X) and target variables (y) for model training and testing. Use a train-test split with a validation set, typically 80% training and 20% testing data.

Neural Network Model:
Create a neural network model using Keras with specified layers, nodes, and activation functions to predict earthquake magnitude and depth based on input features.

Hyperparameter Tuning:
Define hyperparameters with multiple options (e.g., batch size, epochs, optimizer) to find the best-fit model configuration using techniques like grid search or random search.

Finding the Best Fit Model:
Use hyperparameter tuning techniques to find the best-fit model configuration that maximizes performance metrics such as accuracy or mean squared error.

Evaluation on Test Data:
Evaluate the best-fit model on the test data to assess its predictive capabilities. Measure metrics such as loss (e.g., mean squared error) and accuracy to determine the model's effectiveness in earthquake prediction.
