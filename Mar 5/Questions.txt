1.You are given the following :

A positive number N
Heights : A list of heights of N persons standing in a queue
Infronts : A list of numbers corresponding to each person (P) that gives the number of persons who are taller than P and standing in front of P
You need to return  list of actual order of personsâ€™s height

Consider that heights will be unique

Example

Input : 
Heights: 5 3 2 6 1 4
InFronts: 0 1 2 0 3 2
Output : 
actual order is: 5 3 2 1 6 4 
So, you can see that for the person with height 5, there is no one taller than him who is in front of him, and hence Infronts has 0 for him.

For person with height 3, there is 1 person ( Height : 5 ) in front of him who is taller than him.

You can do similar inference for other people in the list.


2.Find shortest unique prefix to represent each word in the list.

Example:

Input: [zebra, dog, duck, dove]
Output: {z, dog, du, dov}
where we can see that
zebra = z
dog = dog
duck = du
dove = dov
NOTE : Assume that no word is prefix of another. In other words, the representation is always possible.

3.Given a 2 x N grid of integer, A, choose numbers such that the sum of the numbers

is maximum and no two chosen numbers are adjacent horizontally, vertically or diagonally, and return it.

Note: You can choose more than 2 numbers.

Input Format:

The first and the only argument of input contains a 2d matrix, A.
Output Format:

Return an integer, representing the maximum possible sum.
Constraints:

1 <= N <= 20000
1 <= A[i] <= 2000
Example:

Input 1:
    A = [   [1]
            [2]    ]

Output 1:
    2

Explanation 1:
    We will choose 2.

Input 2:
    A = [   [1, 2, 3, 4]
            [2, 3, 4, 5]    ]
    
Output 2:
    We will choose 3 and 5.
