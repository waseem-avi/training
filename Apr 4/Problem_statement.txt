Diabetes Prediction Model


Data Description


The Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) is a health-related telephone survey that 
is collected annually by the CDC. Each year, the survey collects responses from over 400,000 
Americans on health-related risk behaviors, chronic health conditions, and the use of 
preventative services. It has been conducted every year since 1984. For this project, a csv of 
the dataset available on Kaggle for the year 2015 was used. This original dataset contains 
responses from 441,455 individuals and has 330 features. These features are either questions 
directly asked of participants, or calculated variables based on individual participant 
responses.
This dataset, diabetes _ 012 _ health _ indicators _ BRFSS2015.csv, is a clean dataset of 253,
680 survey responses to the CDC's BRFSS2015. The target variable Diabetes_012 has 3 classes. 
There is class imbalance in this dataset. This dataset has 21 feature variables
0 is for No Diabetes or only during pregnancy
1 is for Prediabetes, and
2 is for Diabetes.
Research in the field has identified the following as important risk factors for diabetes and 
other chronic illnesses like heart disease (not in strict order of importance):
Blood Pressure (high)
Cholesterol (high)
Smoking
Diabetes
Obesity
Age
Sex
Race
Diet
Exercise
Alcohol Consumption
BMI
Household Income
Marital Status
Sleep
Time since last checkup
Education
Health Care Coverage
Mental Health
Here, Diabetes_012 is our target variable and we will try to predict whether a person has 
diabetes or not based on the 21 features using bagging, specifically the Random Forest 
algorithm, which is an ensemble method based on bagging.




Conclusion


: The accuracy of the classifier on the validation set is approximately 0.848 or . This metric 
measures the overall correctness of the classifier's predictions.: The classification report 
provides additional metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score for each class. Here's a 
breakdown:
For Class 0 (Non-diabetic):
Precision is approximately 0.86, which means that among the instances predicted as class 0, 
Recall is approximately 0.98, which means that among all the actual class 0.0 instances, 
, which is the harmonic mean of precision and recall.
For Class 1 (Pre-diabetic):
Precision is 0.0, which means that  This might indicate an issue with class imbalance or data 
quality.
Recall is 0.0, indicating that 
For class 2.0 (Diabetec):
Precision is approximately 0.56, indicating that 
Recall is approximately 0.16, indicating that 
: The confusion matrix provides a detailed breakdown of true positives, true negatives, false 
positives, and false negatives for each class. It allows you to see how the classifier's 
predictions match with the actual classes.
For Class 0: There are 41,884 true positives (correctly predicted), 0 false positives, and 820 
false negatives.
For Class 1: There are 0 true positives, 0 false positives, and 941 false negatives.
For Class 2: There are 1,132 true positives, 0 false positives, and 5,959 false negatives.
The "UndefinedMetricWarning" indicates that precision and F1-score are ill-defined for Class 1 
because there are no predicted samples for this class, likely due to a lack of Class 1 instances 
in the validation set or an issue with class imbalance.
Overall, the model appears to perform well for Class 0 but struggles with Class 1, possibly due 
to data imbalance or data quality issues for that class. Further analysis and data preprocessing 
may be needed to improve performance on Class 1.
