# *Weekly Assignment: Quiz Game*

# Problem Statement:
# Create a simple command-line quiz game that reads questions from a file, allows users to answer them, and provides a score at the end. The questions and answers should be stored in a text file.

# Question Class:

# Create a Question class with attributes like question_text and correct_answer. Include methods to initialize the question and check if a provided answer is correct.

# File Handling:

# Use a text file (quiz_questions.txt) to store questions and answers. Each line in the file represents a question with the format: <question_text>|<correct_answer>.

# Read Questions:

# Implement a function to read questions from the file and create instances of the Question class for each question.

# Quiz Game Loop:

# Create a loop that presents each question to the user, allows them to input their answer, checks if it's correct, and keeps track of their score.

# Score Calculation:

# Calculate and display the user's score at the end of the quiz.

# Error Handling:

# Implement error handling to handle cases where the file is not found or if there is an issue reading its content.

# Negative Marking:

# If there are 3 wrong answers in the quiz, 1 mark will be deducted.
# There will be no negative marking for one-word answers.
